## Basic Calculator

### Introduction

The Basic Calculator is a command-line application built in Python that allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations. Users can input two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to see the result. This project is designed to demonstrate essential Python programming concepts such as functions, user input, and control flow, and serves as an educational tool.

### Features

- **Addition**: Add two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply two numbers.
- **Division**: Divide the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd basic-calculator
   ```

### Usage

1. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

2. **Select an Operation**:
   The program will prompt you to select an operation:
   ```
   Welcome to the Basic Calculator
   Select an operation:
   1. Addition
   2. Subtraction
   3. Multiplication
   4. Division
   Enter choice (1/2/3/4):
   ```

3. **Enter Numbers**:
   After selecting an operation, you will be prompted to enter two numbers.

4. **View the Result**:
   The result of the operation will be displayed. You can choose to perform another calculation or exit the program.

### Example

```
Welcome to the Basic Calculator
Select an operation:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
The result of 10.0 + 5.0 is 15.0
Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): yes
```
